GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS


build-branch
------------

  on push to any branch,
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows
  - publishes tests results

  note:
  - on forks, enterprise tests are skipped as we cannot share the enterprise key
  - however, contrary to PRs, if the fork is owned by a member of the HZ org,
    the enterprise key is shared


build-pr
--------

  on PR,
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows
  - uploads tests results as artifact

  notes:
  - unless the PR branch itself is a repo branch (not a fork branch) the run does not 
    have permission to publish the tests results, even if the fork is owned by a
    member of the HZ org
  - therefore, this workflow does not publish the tests results, but uploads them as
    artifact - and report-pr will trigger and publishes them

    "With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a 
    workflow is triggered from a forked repository." - even for org members


report-pr
---------

  on build-pr success,
  - downloads tests results artifact
  - publishes tests results 

  notes:
  - because the tests results are published with the original PR SHA, they become
    attached to the build-pr run just as with build-branch runs
  - also, one can navigate from the PR to the results

  
build-release
-------------

  on push to a release/* branch, or a v* tag,
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows, including enterprise tests
  - publishes tests results
  - runs tests coverage and uploads the results as an artifact
  - builds signed and reproducible assemblies and NuGet packages
  - uploads the NuGet packages as an artifact
  - builds the documentation and uploads the patch as an artifact

  on a v* tag,
  - publishes the NuGet packages to NuGet
  - publishes the documentation to GitHub pages
  - deletes the release/* branch


NOTES
-----

  for testing these workflows, one may want to create a PR that does not run all tests,
  as that takes time - there is an undocumented "feature" of the hz.ps1 script: if a
  build/test.filter file exists, its first line will be added to tests filters, so for
  instance
    name =~ /HazelcastTests/
  will restrict the tests to only 3-4 tests that are sure to pass - BEWARE this is for
  experimenting only, do not ever ever merge this test.filter file!
