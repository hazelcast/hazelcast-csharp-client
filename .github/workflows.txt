GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS


build-branch
------------

  on push to any branch, except release/* or a tag
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows
  - publishes tests results

  note:
  - on forks, enterprise tests are skipped as we cannot share the enterprise key
  - however, contrary to PRs, if the fork is owned by a member of the HZ org,
    the enterprise key is shared


build-pr
--------

  on PR,
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows
  - uploads tests results as artifact

  notes:
  - unless the PR branch itself is a repo branch (not a fork branch) the run does not 
    have permission to publish the tests results, even if the fork is owned by a
    member of the HZ org
  - therefore, this workflow does not publish the tests results, but uploads them as
    artifact - and report-pr will trigger and publishes them

    "With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a 
    workflow is triggered from a forked repository." - even for org members


report-pr
---------

  on build-pr success,
  - downloads tests results artifact
  - publishes tests results 

  notes:
  - because the tests results are published with the original PR SHA, they become
    attached to the build-pr run just as with build-branch runs
  - also, one can navigate from the PR to the results

  
build-release
-------------

  on push to a release/* branch, or a v* tag,
  - builds and runs tests both on ubuntu and windows, including enterprise tests
  - publishes tests results
  - runs tests coverage and uploads the results as an artifact
  - builds signed and reproducible assemblies and NuGet packages
  - uploads the NuGet packages as an artifact
  - builds the documentation and uploads the patch as an artifact

  on a v* tag,
  - publishes the NuGet packages to NuGet
  - publishes the documentation to GitHub pages
  - deletes the release/* branch


NOTES
-----

  for testing these workflows, one may want to create a PR that does not run all tests,
  as that takes time - there is an undocumented "feature" of the hz.ps1 script: if a
  build/test.filter file exists, its first line will be added to tests filters, so for
  instance
    name =~ /HazelcastTests/
  will restrict the tests to only 3-4 tests that are sure to pass - BEWARE this is for
  experimenting only, do not ever ever merge this test.filter file!

  from test-reporter README, "Check Runs are created for specific commit SHA. 
  It's not possible to specify under which workflow test report should belong if more
  workflows are running for the same SHA. Thanks to this GitHub "feature" it's possible 
  your test report will appear in an unexpected place in GitHub UI." -- so, better not
  trigger multiple builds on the same SHA
