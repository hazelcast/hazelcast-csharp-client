GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS


dotcover-report
---------------

  copies the test coverage results as a workflow check run so that it's easy to get the numbers

  action was coded from tutorial at
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action

  in order to code the action, you will need to
  - upgrade to latest node by downloading it & installing it
  - upgrade to latest npm
    this may require a bit of cleanup:
      rm -rf ~/AppData/Roaming/npm
      npm cache clear --force
      npm install -g npm@latest

  then
    npm init -y
    npm install @actions/core
    npm install @actions/github
    npm install -g @vercel/ncc

  edit action.yml, index.js, package.json... and then build:
  npm run pack

  which runs 'ncc build index.js -o dist' and produces dist/index.js
    
  - troubleshoot
    define ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true repository secret to see core.debug messages    

  - beware!
    do NOT commit the node_modules directory
