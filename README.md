# Hazelcast .NET Client

This branch is a major refactoring of the public APIs of the client, as well as its internal architecture, to better align with standard .NET practices as well as improve performances, and lay out a foundation for future .NET developments.

### What to expect

> CODE IN THIS BRANCH IS IN NO WAY SUITABLE FOR ANY PRODUCTION USE

In its current state, the entire .NET client has been refactored. It is possible to review the code, both public-facing APIs and internal architecture.

A few architecture decisions still need to be finalized.

The code contains a fair amount of `// FIXME` and `// TODO` comments indicating places that *must* or *could* be discussed and changed before considering release.

Examples and tests are still work in progress and a lot of them are missing from this public repository; they will be added soon.

This README file will be updated to indicate progress.
