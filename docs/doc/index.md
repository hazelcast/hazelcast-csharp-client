# Documentation

This section contains the complete documentation for the Hazelcast .NET solution, with examples, guides and FAQ.

Hazelcast .NET only provides a client-side implementation, and needs to connect to a fully configured Hazelcast 
cluster. Refer to the [Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/)
for a complete documentation.

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions.
This section also documents how to obtain the source code, build the solution, interact with the community, and 
contribute. It also documents the internals of the solution, which can be useful for
contributors.

The Hazelcast .NET documentation is work-in-progress and is not yet complete.
