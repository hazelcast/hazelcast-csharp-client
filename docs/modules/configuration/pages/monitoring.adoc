= Configuring for Monitoring

The Hazelcast .NET client can collect and send metrics to the cluster. These metrics can then be analyzed using the Hazelcast Management Center. It is, for instance, possible to monitor the clients that are connected to the cluster.

Metrics, and the Management Center, are fully documented https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/latest/index.html[here]. The Hazelcast .NET client sends the following pieces of information:

* Client name, type and address
* Client connection timestamp
* Memory stats (commited size, max size, total size...)
* CPU stats (CPU time, CPUs count...)

Metrics are configured via the Metrics configuration options: metrics can be enabled via the `hazelcast.metrics.enabled` configuration option. When enabled, metrics are sent to the cluster every `hazelcast.metrics.periodSeconds` seconds.
