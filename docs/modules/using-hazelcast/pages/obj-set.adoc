= HSet

`HSet` is a distributed set corresponding to a server-side set which can be considered as a distributed implementation of the well-known C# `IHashSet<T>`. `HSet` is a specialized `IHCollection`.

The set behavior can be configured on the server; see its xref:hazelcast:data-structures:set.adoc[documentation] for the complete details.

== Defining Sets

Sets are fully identified by their type and unique name, regardless of the types specified for set items. In other words, an `HSet<string>` and `HSet<int>` named with the same name are backed by the same cluster structure. Obviously, referring to a set with types other than the expected types can have unspecified consequences (probably, serialization errors) and is not recommended.

The items type can be just about any valid .NET type, provided that it can be (de)serialized by the Hazelcast .NET Client (see the xref:serialization:overview.adoc[Serialization documentation]). It does not necessarily need to be (de)serializable by the cluster, as long as the cluster does not need to handle them as objects, and can treat them as plain binary blobs. As soon as the cluster needs to handle the objects themselves, the types must also be (de)serializable by the cluster.

== Creating & Destroying Sets

A set is obtained from the Hazelcast .NET Client, and is created on-demand: if a set with the specified name already exists on the cluster, it is returned, otherwise it is created on the cluster. For instance:

[source,csharp]
----
var set = await client.GetSetAsync<string>("my-set");
----

Sets should be disposed after usage, in order to release their resources. Note that this only releases client-side resources, but the actual data remain available on the cluster for further usage. In order to wipe the set and its data entirely from the cluster, it needs to be destroyed:

[source,csharp]
----
await set.DestroyAsync();
----

== Using Sets

The `HSet` structure is completely documented in the associated {apiDocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.DistributedObjects.IHSet-1.html[`IHSet<T>`] reference documentation. It provides methods to manipulate items, such as:

* `AddAsync(item)` adds an item to the set
* `GetAllAsync()` retrieves the items
* `ContainsAsync(item)` determines whether the set contains an item
* `GetSizeAsync()` gets the number of items, and `IsEmptyAsync()` determines whether the set is empty
* `RemoveAsync(index)` removes an item

The `HSet` structure exposes events (see the xref:events.adoc[events documentation]) at set level. A complete list of events is provided in the {apiDocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.DistributedObjects.CollectionItemEventHandlers-1.html[CollectionItemEventHandlers<T> documentation]. The following example illustrates how to subscribe and unsubscribe to set events:

[source,csharp]
----
var id = await set.SubscribeAsync(events => events
    .ItemAdded((sender, args) => {
        logger.LogInformation($"Item {args.Item} was added.")
    }));

// ...

await set.UnsubscribeAsync(id);
----

Note that the handler methods passed to, e.g., `ItemRemoved` or `Cleared`, can be asynchronous, too.
