# Hazelcast .NET
Hazelcast .NET brings the full power of the [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com) high-performance, 
in-memory computing platform to the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. The 
[Hazelcast .NET Client](https://hazelcast.org/imdg/clients-languages/dotnet/) allows you to
elastically scale your .NET caches at high read speeds, to access all of Hazelcast data structures
such as distributed maps, queues, topics and more--all with enterprise level security through SSL 
and mutual authentication.

Hazelcast .NET is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hazelcast.Net/)
for netstandard 2.0 and 2.1, and is supported on Windows (.NET Framework 4.6.2 and above, .NET
Core 2.1 and 3.1) and Linux (.NET Core 2.1 and 3.1).
