# Documentation

This section contains the complete documentation for the Hazelcast .NET solution, with examples, guides and FAQ.

Hazelcast .NET only provides a client-side implementation, and needs to connect to a fully configured Hazelcast cluster. Refer to the [Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/) for a complete documentation of the server side of Hazelcast.

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions. This section also documents how to obtain the source code, build the solution, interact with the community, and contribute. It also documents the internals of the solution, which can be useful for
contributors.
