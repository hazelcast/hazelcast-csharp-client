# Distributed Objects

Distributed objects are managed by an Hazelcast cluster, and accessed via the Hazelcast .NET client. Currently, the client supports the following distributed objects:

* [HDictionary](hdictionary.md) - a distributed key/value store corresponding to a cluster-side [Map](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#map)
* [HList](hlist.md) - a distributed list store corresponding to a cluster-side [List](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#list)
