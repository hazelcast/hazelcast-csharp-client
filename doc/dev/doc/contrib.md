# Contributing

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions. The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client). This section details how to obtain the source code and build the solution, in order to experiment with the code... and contribute!

You can engage with the Hazelcast team, and the community at large, via several channels:
* Post questions on our [GitHub](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client) repository
* Join our [Slack](https://slack.hazelcast.com/) community and head for the `#dotnet-client` channel

If you are looking for contribution ideas, you can loop for our [list of "good first issues"](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).

But contribution is not only about code: raising issues or asking questions is as most as important... and even more important: documentation is also Open Source. The documentation you are currently reading is served by GitHub Pages and lives in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client/tree/gh-pages) branch of the source repository. We also gladly accept PRs for the documentation!
