# Vector Collection

![Note] This feature is available in Hazelcast Enterprise.

A `VectorCollection` is a collection of `VectorDocument` objects. For more information see
[the vector collection documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/data-structures/vector-collections#hide-nav).

In order to use vector collection, you should configure the vector collection in the member. For more information see
[the vector collection configuration](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/data-structures/vector-collections#configuration).


## Creating a Vector Collection

After creating a Hazelcast .Net client and configuring the Hazelcast cluster, you can create a `VectorCollection` as follows:

```csharp
await using var vectorCollection = await client.GetVectorCollectionAsync<string, HazelcastJsonValue>("vector-example");
```

### Adding a Document to the Vector Collection

You can add a document to the vector collection as follows:

```csharp
var metaData = new HazelcastJsonValue("{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}");

var vectorDoc = VectorDocument<HazelcastJsonValue>
                .Of(metaData, VectorValues.Of(new float[] { 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f }));

await vectorCollection.SetAsync("person-1", vectorDoc);
```

_*The vector values should be generated by a model._ 

### Getting a Document from the Vector Collection

You can get a document from the vector collection as follows:

```csharp
var vectorDoc = await vectorCollection.GetAsync("person-1");
```

### Removing a Document from the Vector Collection

You can remove a document from the vector collection as follows:

```csharp
await vectorCollection.RemoveAsync("person-1");
```

### Querying the Vector Collection

You can query the vector collection as follows:

```csharp
var queryVector = VectorValues.Of(new float[] { 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f });

var result = await vectorCollection.SearchAsync(queryVector,
      new VectorSearchOptions(includeVectors: true,
             includeValue: true,
             limit: 3
));

foreach (var entry in result.Results)
{
    // Do something with the result
}
```

After generating the vector that you like query, you also define the search options for additional information.
