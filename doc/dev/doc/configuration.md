# Client Configuration

Configuration follows the [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration)
patterns. The Hazelcast client configuration is represented by the @Hazelcast.HazelcastOptions class.

Configuration can be provided through various [sources](configuration/sources.md) which include configuration files, environment variables or command-line arguments.

Options that can be configured are fully documented on the [options](configuration/options.md) page.
