== AtomicLong

NOTE: IAtomicLong is a member of CP Subsystem API. For detailed information, see the xref:using-hazelcast:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP SubSystem documentation].

Hazelcast IAtomicLong is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong` and offers most of its operations such as `Get`, `Set`, `GetAndSet`, `CompareAndSet`, and `IncrementAndGet`. You can also think of it as implementing most of @`System.Interlocked` methods for `long` (`System.Int64`) distributed values. Since IAtomicLong is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and thus their performances differ from local, in-memory, atomic longs.

The following example code creates an instance, increments it by a million and prints the count.

[source,csharp]
----
await using var client = await HazelcastClientFactory.StartNewClientAsync();
await using var counter = await client.CPSubSystem.GetAtomicLongAsync("counter-unique-name");

for (int i = 0; i < 1000 * 1000; i++ )
{
    if (i % 500000 == 0)
        Console.WriteLine($"At: {i}");

    await counter.IncrementAndGetAsync();
}
Console.WriteLine($"Count is {await counter.GetAsync()}");
----

When you start other instances with the code above, you will see the count as member count times a million.

Note that sending functions to and executing functions on AtomicLong as documented for the xref:hazelcast:data-structures:iatomiclong.adoc[Java client] are not supported by the .NET client.

== AtomicReference

NOTE: IAtomicReference is a member of CP Subsystem API. For detailed information, see the xref:using-hazelcast:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP SubSystem documentation].

Hazelcast IAtomicReference is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference` and offers most of its operations such as `Get`, `Set`, `GetAndSet`, and `CompareAndSet`. You can also think of `GetAndSet`, `CompareAndSet` as `@System.Interlocked Exchange` and `CompareExchange` methods for distributed values. Since IAtomicReference is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and thus their performances differ from local, in-memory, references.

The following example code adds a dot the end of any string added to the shared reference:

[source,csharp]
----
var cancellationSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
var cancellationToken = cancellationSource.Token;

await using var client = await HazelcastClientFactory.StartNewClientAsync(options);
await using var sentence = await client.CPSubsystem.GetAtomicReferenceAsync<string>("sentence-unique-key");

while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    var value = await sentence.GetAsync();

    if (value != null && !value.EndsWith("."))
    {
        var newValue = value + ".";

        if (!await sentence.CompareAndSetAsync(value, newValue))
            continue;
    }

    await Task.Delay(100, cancellationToken);
}

await sentence.DestroyAsync();
----

Note that sending functions to, and executing functions on AtomicReference as documented for the xref:hazelcast:data-structures:iatomiclong.adoc[Java client] are not supported by the .NET client.

== FencedLock

[NOTE]
====
`IFencedLock` is a member of CP Subsystem API. For detailed information, see the xref:using-hazelcast:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP SubSystem documentation].

The original Java xref:hazelcast:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] and 
xref:hazelcast:data-structures:fencedlock[FencedLock documentation] may help get a
better understanding of the .NET `IFencedLock` implementation.
====

Hazelcast {apidocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.CP.IFencedLock.html[`IFencedLock`] is a linearizable and
distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`, meaning that if you lock using a FencedLock,
the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster.
Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly.
Also note that Hazelcast Lock does not support fairness.
Since FencedLock is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and thus their performances differ from local, in-memory references.

`IFencedLock` is CP with respect to the CAP principle. It works on top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers 
linearizability during crash-stop failures and network partitions. If a network partition occurs, it remains 
available on at most one side of the partition.

By default, `IFencedLock` is reentrant. Once a caller acquires the lock, it can acquire the lock reentrantly as many
times as it wants in a linearizable manner. You can configure the reentrancy behavior via the cluster configuration.
For instance, reentrancy can be disabled and FencedLock can work as a non-reentrant mutex. You can also set a 
custom reentrancy limit. When the reentrancy limit is already reached, IFencedLock does not block a lock call. 
Instead, it fails with an exception or a specified return value.

Distributed locks are unfortunately not equivalent to single-node mutexes because of the complexities in distributed 
systems, such as uncertain communication patterns, and independent and partial failures. In an asynchronous network, 
no lock service can guarantee mutual exclusion, because there is no way to distinguish between a slow and a crashed 
process. This can be mitigated with *fences* (see xref:hazelcast:data-structures:fencedlock[CP SubSystem FencedLock documentation]
for details): lock holders are ordered by a monotonic fencing token, which increments each time the lock is assigned 
to a new owner. This fencing token can be passed to external services or resources to ensure sequential execution of 
the side effects performed by lock holders.

=== Lock Context

The original Java FencedLock is thread-based, much like the .NET `lock` statement is. In the distributed world, this
means that the *context* of a lock ownership is a unique thread, for a unique client connection. In other words, the
concept of *thread* is extended to the entire distributed system, and the lock context is this thread.

This however does not work well with .NET asynchronous programming model, just as the `lock` statement does not either.
Indeed, the following code is illegal (and would not compile) because the asynchronous `await` could cause the execution
flow to continue on any thread.

[source,csharp]
----
lock (mutex) // locks acquired by the current thread
{
    // this is still the current thread
    await DoSomething();
    // this can be any thread!
}
----

In C# programming, developers know that they cannot mix the `lock` statement with asynchronous programming, and 
typically use an explicit structure such as a semaphore, which becomes the lock context:

[source,csharp]
----
await semaphore.WaitAsync();
try
{
    await DoSomething();
}
finally 
{
    semaphore.Release();
}
----

Hazelcast FencedLock provides and requires an explicit lock context object. Every FencedLock operation
executes within that context, which needs to be passed around in code. The code then becomes:

[source,csharp]
----
var lockContext = new LockContext();
await fencedLock.LockAsync(lockContext);
try
{
    await DoSomething();
}
finally 
{
    await fencedLock.UnlockAsync(lockContext);
}
----

=== Example

The following simple example creates and uses a `IFencedLock`:

[source,csharp]
----
var cancellationSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
var cancellationToken = cancellationSource.Token;
await using var client = await HazelcastClientFactory.StartNewClientAsync(options);
await using var fencedLock = await client.CPSubsystem.GetLockAsync("lock-name");
var lockContext = new LockContext();
await fencedLock.LockAsync(lockContext); // acquires the lock for lockContext (count = 1)
await fencedLock.LockAsync(lockContext); // re-enters the lock for lockContext (count = 2)
var otherContext = new LockContext();
var task = Task.Run(async () => {
    // acquires the lock for otherContext
    // blocks as long as the lock is owned by lockContext
    await fencedLock.LockAsync(otherContext);
});
await fencedLock.UnlockAsync(lockContext); // exits the lock for lockContext (count = 1)
await fencedLock.UnlockAsync(lockContext); // releases the lock for lockContext
await task; // completes now that lockContext does not own the lock anymore
await fencedLock.UnlockAsync(otherContext); // releases the lock for otherContext
await fencedLock.DestroyAsync();
----

=== Notes

Locks are fail-safe. If a member holds a lock and some other members go down, the cluster will keep your 
locks safe and available. Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that dead 
member will be removed so that those locks are immediately available for live members.

Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast does not automatically 
perform garbage collection in the lock. This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create locks on 
the fly, make sure they are destroyed.

Locks are re-entrant. The same context can lock multiple times on the same lock. Note that for other 
contexts to be able to require this lock, the owner of the lock must call unlock as many times as the 
owner called lock.

Refer to the original Java xref:hazelcast:data-structures:fencedlock.adoc[FencedLock documentation] for a better understanding of FencedLock and fencing.

== FlakeIdGenerator

A FlakeIdGenerator is a cluster-wide unique identifier generator. The identifiers are long primitive values in the range from 0 to `long.MaxValue` and are k-ordered, i.e., roughly ordered. See xref:hazelcast:data-structures:flake-id-generator.adoc[FlakeIdGenerator section] of the Hazelcast Platform documentation for more details.

The identifiers contain a timestamp component, and a member identifier component which is assigned when the member joins the cluster. This allows identifiers to be ordered and unique without any coordination between members, thus making the generator safe even in split-brain scenario.

=== Using FlakeIdGenerator

A FlakeIdGenerator is obtained from the Hazelcast .NET Client as follows.

[source,csharp]
----
var generator = await client.GetFlakeIdGeneratorAsync("my-generator");
var id1 = await generator.GetNewIdAsync();
var id2 = await generator.GetNewIdAsync();
await generator.DisposeAsync();
----

=== Configuring FlakeIdGenerator


To avoid frequent round-trips to the members, a client usually prefetches a batch of identifiers. The size of each batch can be configured via the {apiDocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.DistributedObjects.FlakeIdGeneratorOptions.PrefetchCount.html#Hazelcast_DistributedObjects_FlakeIdGeneratorOptions_PrefetchCount[`PrefetchCount `] option; allowed values are between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, and the default value is 100.

In order to preserve rough ordering, a batch of identifiers is only valid for a given amount of time, which can be configured via the {apiDocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.DistributedObjects.FlakeIdGeneratorOptions.PrefetchValidityPeriod.html#Hazelcast_DistributedObjects_FlakeIdGeneratorOptions_PrefetchValidityPeriod[`PrefetchValidityPeriod`] option.
If you do not care about ordering, this option can be set to `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan`. The default value is 10 minutes.

Each generator can be configured, based upon its name as follows.

[source,csharp]
----
options.FlakeIdGenerator["my-generator"] = new FlakeIdGeneratorOptions
{
    PrefetchCount = 40,
    PrefetchValidityPeriod = Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan
}
----

If no configuration exists for a specified generator name, then the default configuration is used. The default configuration for all generators can be modified via the special * wildcard name:

[source,csharp]
----
options.FlakeIdGenerator["*"] = new FlakeIdGeneratorOptions
{
    PrefetchCount = 40,
    PrefetchValidityPeriod = Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan
}
----

The configuration for a specified name is determined via the `IPatternMatcher` configured via the {apiDocBaseUrl}/Hazelcast.HazelcastOptions.PatternMatcher.html#Hazelcast_HazelcastOptions_PatternMatcher[`PatternMatcher`] property, and therefore wildcards are supported. See also the general xref:configuration:overview.adoc[configuration documentation].
