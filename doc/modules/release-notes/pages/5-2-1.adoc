= 5.2.1 Release Notes

This version is a minor release and therefore is fully backward-compatible with all 5.x and 4.x versions.

When version 5.2.0 was released, the various NuGet packages were built in two different batches, ending with different signatures, and some packages being incompatible with others.

This release is a re-release of version 5.2.0 which simply rebuilds the NuGet packages so they happily all work together.

The codebase has not change in any way.
