= Overview

The SQL service provided by Hazelcast .NET client allows you to query data stored in `IHMap` declaratively.

== Expressions

Hazelcast SQL supports logical predicates, `IS` predicates, comparison operators, mathematical functions and operators, string functions, and special functions. See xref:hazelcast:sql:functions-and-operators.adoc[Expressions, Functions and Operators] in Hazelcast Platform documentation for all possible operations.

== Lite Members

You cannot start SQL queries on lite members. This limitation will be removed in future releases.

== Additional Information

See the xref:hazelcast:sql:sql-overview.adoc[SQL chapter] in Hazelcast Platform documentation for more information.
