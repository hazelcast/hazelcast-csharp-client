# Welcome!

Hazelcast .NET brings the full power of the [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com) high-performance, in-memory computing platform to the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. The 
[Hazelcast .NET Client](https://hazelcast.org/imdg/clients-languages/dotnet/) allows you to elastically scale your .NET caches at high read speeds, to access all of Hazelcast data structures such as distributed maps, queues, topics and more. All, with enterprise level security through SSL and mutual authentication.

This site provides a complete [documentation](doc-index.md) with examples, guides and FAQs. It also provides a complete [reference documentation](api-index.md) for the public API, generated from source-code-level comments, and complemented with additional content.

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions. The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client). This documentation also details how to obtain the source code, build the solution, interact with the community, and contribute. 

Oh, and a documentation documentation site is, usually, a never-ending work-in-progress. Documentation itself is open to contributions, too. Find anything that you think could be improved? Reach out to us!
