Hazelcast .NET only provides a client-side implementation, and needs to connect to a fully configured Hazelcast cluster. Refer to the [Hazelcast General Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/home/index.html) for a complete documentation of the server side of Hazelcast.

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions. The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client). In the documentation you can also find out how to obtain the source code, build the solution, interact with the community, and contribute.

Oh, and a documentation documentation site is, usually, a never-ending work-in-progress. Documentation itself is open to contributions, too. Find anything that you think could be improved? Reach out to us!
