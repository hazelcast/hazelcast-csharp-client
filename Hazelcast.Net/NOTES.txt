#### NOTES ABOUT ATOMICITY

Partition I, Section 12.6.6 of the CLI spec states: "A conforming CLI shall guarantee
that read and write access to properly aligned memory locations no larger than the native
word size is atomic when all the write accesses to a location are the same size."

And, C# specs section 5.5 states: "Reads and writes of the following data types are
atomic: bool, char, byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, int, float, and reference types.
In addition, reads and writes of enum types with an underlying type in the previous
list are also atomic. Reads and writes of other types, including long, ulong, double,
and decimal, as well as user-defined types, are not guaranteed to be atomic."

However - atomic does not imply thread-safety due to the processor reordering reads and
writes. The variables should be marked volatile, or accessed through Interlocked.

So,
Anything safe as per section 5.5 quoted above has to be volatile
Anything not safe has to be Interlocked.


#### NOTES ABOUT HASHING

In most cases, we keep the original hashing code instead of replacing it with more
recent and more efficient code available for instance in netstandard 2.1, because before
we replace the code we need to make sure that it is OK wrt the other clients.

#### NOTES ABOUT CONFIGURE AWAIT

Although not relevant on .NET Core anymore, ConfigureAwait(false) is still important
in libraries that can be used with the .NET Framework. such as Hazelcast.NET. While we
could think about weaving it automatically (e.g. with Fody) this is considered too
cumbersome for now. Instead, we use our own .CAF() extension methods, that could be
easily nullified with [Conditional] code.

#### NOTES ABOUT FILE NAMING

Class Foo goes into file Foo.cs
Class Bar nested into class Foo goes into file Foo+Bar.cs
Partial of class Foo for Bar purpose goes into file Foo.Bar.cs
Class Foo<T> goes into file Foo`T.cs if needed
Class Foo<T,U> goes into file Foo`TU.cs if needed

Static classes defining extension methods are named FooBarExtensions where FooBar
indicates what is being extended and, if necessary, for what purpose.

### NOTES ABOUT TIMEOUT AND CANCELLATION

Every internal asynchronous method can be cancelled via a CancellationToken. Every
public-facing asynchronous method can be cancelled via a CancellationToken, and also
exposes an overload accepting a TimeSpan which indicates a timeout.

Methods which are naturally cancelled throw OperationCancelledException whereas
methods that reach their timeout throw TimeoutException.

#### NOTES ABOUT C# VERSION

Decision to use C# 8.0 on all projects, avoiding features not supported by netstandard 2.0.
"nullable" is currently not enabled because of the amount of warnings, consider it.

#### NOTES ABOUT TASK vs VALUETASK

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/15809

ValueTask can greatly improve performances when tasks may complete synchronously,
but there may be drawbacks too - in fact, the recommendation seems to be to bubble
ValueTask up when possible, else use Task by default, until actual performance
benchmarking shows that ValueTask brings some benefits.


#### NOTES ABOUT COMPARING TO NULL

C# specs section 7.10.6 states that "The x == null construct is permitted even though T could represent
a value type, and the result is simply defined to be false when T is a value type." so the line below is
safe even when key is of type TKey which can be a value type... BUT see Eric Lippert answer
on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8823239 for caveats.

if (key == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(key));
