    /// PN (Positive-Negative) CRDT counter.

    /// <remarks>
    /// The counter supports adding and subtracting values as well as retrieving the current counter value.
    /// Each replica of this counter can perform operations locally without coordination with the other replicas, 
    /// thus increasing availability.
    /// The counter guarantees that whenever two nodes have received the same set of updates, 
    /// possibly in a different order, their state is identical, and any conflicting updates are merged automatically.
    /// If no new updates are made to the shared state, all nodes that can communicate will eventually have the same data.
    ///
    /// The updates to this counter are applied locally when invoked on a CRDT replica. 
    /// A replica can be any hazelcast instance which is not a client or a lite member. 
    /// The number of replicas in the cluster is determined by the PNCounterConfig configuration value.
    ///
    /// When invoking updates from non-replica instance, the invocation is remote.
    /// This may lead to indeterminate state - the update may be applied but the response has not been received.
    /// In this case, the caller will be notified with a <see cref="TargetDisconnectedException"/> when invoking from a client.
    ///
    /// The read and write methods provide monotonic read and RYW(read - your - write) guarantees.
    /// These guarantees are session guarantees which means that if no replica with the previously observed state is reachable,
    /// the session guarantees are lost and the method invocation will throw a <see cref="ConsistencyLostException"/>. 
    /// This does not mean that an update is lost.All of the updates are part of some replica 
    /// and will be eventually reflected in the state of all other replicas. This exception just means 
    /// that you cannot observe your own writes because all replicas that contain your updates are currently unreachable.
    /// After you have received a <see cref="ConsistencyLostException"/>, you can either
    /// wait for a sufficiently up - to - date replica to become reachable in which
    /// case the session can be continued or you can reset the session by calling the <see cref="Reset()"/> method.
    /// If you have called the <see cref="Reset()"/> method, a new session is started with the next invocation 
    /// to a CRDT replica.
    /// <b> NOTE:</b>
    /// The CRDT state is kept entirely on non-lite(data) members. 
    /// If there aren't any and the methods here are invoked on a lite member, they will fail with an <see cref="NoDataMemberInClusterException"/>
