    ///     <p />
    ///     ISemaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore.  Conceptually,
    ///     it maintains a set of permits.  Each
    ///     <see cref="Acquire()">Acquire()</see>
    ///     blocks if necessary until
    ///     a permit is available, and then takes it.  Each
    ///     <see cref="Release()">Release()</see>
    ///     adds a permit,
    ///     potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. However, no actual permit objects are
    ///     used; the semaphore just keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
    ///     <p/>The Hazelcast distributed semaphore implementation guarantees that
    ///     threads invoking any of the
    ///     <see cref="Acquire()">acquire</see>
    ///     methods are selected
    ///     to obtain permits in the order in which their invocation of those methods
    ///     was processed(first-in-first-out; FIFO).  Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
    ///     applies to specific internal points of execution within the cluster.  So,
    ///     it is possible for one member to invoke
    ///     <c>acquire</c>
    ///     before another, but reach
    ///     the ordering point after the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
    ///     <p />This class also provides convenience methods to
    ///     <see cref="Acquire(int)">acquire</see>
    ///     and
    ///     <see cref="Release(int)">release</see>
    ///     multiple
    ///     permits at a time.  Beware of the increased risk of indefinite
    ///     postponement when using the multiple acquire.  If a single permit is
    ///     released to a semaphore that is currently blocking, a thread waiting
    ///     for one permit will acquire it before a thread waiting for multiple
    ///     permits regardless of the call order.
