        // NOTES
        //
        // - we cannot have two connections to the same member ID at the same time, the AddConnection
        //   method makes sure that a second connection to the same member ID is either rejected, or
        //   replaces the existing one (depending on conditions).
        //
        // - a member can be associated with 3 addresses:
        //  - the address that we connected to
        //  - the address that was reported by the member when we connected to it
        //  - the address that was associated with the member in the members list
        //
        // we have always ignored the second address (as Java does) - we used to ignore the third
        // address too (as Java does) BUT this means that if we connect to a cluster via a load-
        // balancer, as is proposed in some k8s examples, traffic keeps going through the load-
        // balancer - and this is not ideal - so we implemented the following logic:
        //
        // - each member exposes a ConnectAddress which derives from the members list, and is the
        //   address that we assume the member wants us to connect to
        // - when we connect to a member at an address, and then later on receive a member list
        //   proposing a *different* address for the member, we terminate the original connection,
        //   triggering the reconnection mechanism to the member's ConnectAddress
        //
        // however, this breaks non-smart routing, as the reconnection mechanism does NOT activate
        // when routing is not smart : when the original connection is terminated, the client remains
        // disconnected.
        //
        // a general discussion is needed as to which address to use for members, in all clients.
        // however, in the short term, we need to fix non-smart routing, with two possible choices:
        // - run the reconnection mechanism for non-smart routing
        // - make the address-switching logic optional & disabled for non-smart routing
        //
        // the first option may have unintended consequences, whereas the second "just" brings back
        // the old logic for non-smart routing -> we choose the second option and implement a
        // switch feature in MatchMemberAddress

        // more notes:
        // the "match" logic assumes that the connect queue is always running and this is a bad
        // idea - it should only run once one connection has been fully established and the client
        // is considered connected - but then, the "match" logic cannot work and must be refactored.
