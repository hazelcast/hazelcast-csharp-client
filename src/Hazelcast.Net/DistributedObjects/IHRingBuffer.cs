    /// won't grow beyond that capacity and endanger the stability of the system. If that capacity is exceeded, than the oldest
    /// item in the ringbuffer is overwritten.
    /// The ringbuffer has 2 always incrementing sequences:
    /// <ol>
    /// <li>
    /// tailSequence: this is the side where the youngest item is found. So the tail is the side of the ringbuffer where
    /// items are added to.
    /// </li>
    /// <li>
    /// headSequence: this is the side where the oldest items are found. So the head is the side where items gets
    /// discarded.
    /// </li>
    /// </ol>
    /// The items in the ringbuffer can be found by a sequence that is in between (inclusive) the head and tail sequence.

    /// <see cref="StaleSequenceException"/>
    /// is thrown.
    /// A Ringbuffer currently is not a distributed data-structure. So all data is stored in a single partition; comparable to the

    /// A Ringbuffer can be used in a similar way as a queue, but one of the key differences is that a queue.take is destructive,
    /// meaning that only 1 thread is able to take an item. A ringbuffer.read is not destructive, so you can have multiple threads
