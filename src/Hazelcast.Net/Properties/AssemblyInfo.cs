// We propose to accept that the code is not CLS Compliant anymore (remove
// the CLSCompliant attribute), i.e. to stop actively indicating that the
// code complies with the Common Language Specification (CLS) and can be
// considered language-independent. There are great debates in the .NET
// community about whether this is important or not, but the main argument
// is that Microsoft has dropped explicit compliance from most of its
// Microsoft.Extensions.* library, and .NET Core.
//
// This does not mean that the Hazelcast library is not language-independent.
// Only, we don't indicate that we are, because in order to do so we would
// need to drop all dependencies on common Microsoft libraries. However,
// we should aim at being language-independent.
