/// Represents a countdown latch which is a backed-up distributed alternative to the

/// that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being
/// performed in other threads completes.
/// It works on top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers linearizability
/// during crash failures and network partitions. It is CP with respect to the CAP
/// principle. If a network partition occurs, it remains available on at most one
/// side of the partition.
