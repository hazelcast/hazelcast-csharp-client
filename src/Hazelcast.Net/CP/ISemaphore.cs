/// <summary>
/// Defines a CP distributed semaphore.
/// </summary>
/// 
/// <remarks>
/// 
/// <para>ISemaphore is a fault-tolerant distributed semaphore. Semaphores are often used
/// to restrict the number of threads than can access some physical or logical resource.</para>
/// <para>ISemaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore. Conceptually, it maintains a set
/// of permits. Permits are acquired with the <see cref="AcquireAsync"/> and <see cref="TryAcquireAsync"/>
/// functions, and released with the <see cref="ReleaseAsync"/> function. No actual permit objects
/// are used: the semaphore just keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.</para>
/// 
/// <para>Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention in the
/// application. A semaphore is obtained via <code>client.CPSubsystem.GetSemaphoreAsync(name)</code>
/// and works on top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers linearizability during crash
/// failures and network partitions. It is CP with respect to the CAP principle. If a network
/// partition occurs, it remains available on at most one side of the partition.</para>
///
/// <para>There are two variations of the <see cref="ISemaphore"/> interface.</para>
///
/// <para>The default implementation is session-aware. When a caller interacts with the semaphore
/// for the first time, it starts a new CP session within the underlying CP group. Liveliness of
/// the session is then tracked via this CP session. Should the caller fails, permits acquired by
/// this client are automatically and safely released.</para>
/// <para>Note however that a session-aware semaphore cannot release permits that have not been
/// acquired beforehand; in other words it can only release previously acquired permits. It is
/// possible to acquire a permit on one lock context, and release it on another lock context
/// from the same client, but not from different clients.</para>
///
/// <para>The second impl offered by { @link CPSubsystem} is session-less. This implementation
/// does not perform auto-cleanup of acquired permits on failures. Acquired permits are not bound to
/// a client and permits can be released without being acquired first. This would be more
/// compatible with Java's semaphore release mode. It can be enabled by enabling JDK compatibility
/// when configuring the semaphore.</para>
/// <para>Note however that the user needs to handle failed permit owners on their own. If a server
/// or a client fails while holding some permits, they will not be automatically released.</para>
///
/// <para>There is a subtle difference between the lock and semaphore abstractions.</para>
/// <para>A lock can be assigned to at most one endpoint at a time, so we have a total order among
/// its holders. On the other hand, permits of a semaphore can be assigned to multiple endpoints
/// at a time, which implies that we may not have a total order among permit holders. In fact,
/// permit holders are partially ordered.</para>
